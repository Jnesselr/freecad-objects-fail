This is a simple test repo used to reproduce a bug in FreeCAD. The issue is that on some installations, running the included python script will show a part called "Body" but on other installations (like Ubuntu 20.04 LTS in GitHub actions or a Digital Ocean server) will only show things like sketch planes and datums.

The included setup shell script is only designed to work on Ubuntu. Run the python script with python3. The part included here is from Stephen Hawes' Index PnP project where this bug was first identified.
